Purpose: Grit is the disposition to strive for long-term goals despite setbacks and challenges. Given the lengthy, arduous process of rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), an athlete’s grit may predict success in recovering physical function and activity levels across time post-operatively. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between baseline (pre-operative) grit and post-operative knee outcomes across the year after ACLR among adolescents.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal prospective cohort study with a registry of adolescent athletes undergoing ACLR by one surgeon at a single institution.
All participants completed the following questionnaires at a pre-operative appointment and then again at approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after ACLR: Short Grit Scale (Grit-S), Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi- IKDC), Scale Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, PROMIS pediatric scale for pain interference and mobility, Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS), Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (NeuroQoL) Lower Extremity Function Short Form. We constructed linear mixed models to assess the relationships between baseline grit, time, age, sex, and post-operative outcomes measures (statistical significance of a=0.05). 

Results: We included 137 participants (mean age 15.8 +/- 2.74 years, 70% female) in the registry. There were no statistically significant changes in grit over time or differences in grit between age or sex. Higher baseline grit was significantly associated with greater post-operative HSS Pedi-Fabs scores (β = 3.72 +/- 1.46, p=0.01, 95% CI: [0.85, 6.59]) and NeuroQoL scores across time (β = 3.37 +/- 0.93, p<0.001, 95% CI: [1.55, 5.20]). There were no significant associations between baseline grit and Pedi-IKDC, Lysholm, PROMIS pain interference or mobility scores. 

Conclusion: Our data demonstrated a significant association between grit and post-operative physical function and activity levels (as measured by HSS Pedi-FABS and NeuroQOL scores) over time but not between grit and the remaining outcome measures.  This finding suggests that grittier athletes may achieve greater physical function over the course of ACLR rehabilitation compared to less gritty athletes, possibly related to the nature of attaining activity-related goals as opposed to symptom improvement. 

Significance: Grit may be a useful predictor in attainment of physical function and activity levels across the course of rehabilitation following ACLR in adolescent athletes. Future research is necessary to further elucidate the relationship between grit, injury recovery, and return to sport outcomes and to understand if and how grit can be used to predict success in rehabilitation.
